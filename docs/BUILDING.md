# Building BERT

These notes describe the build as it stands on the `r4-support` branch. The
"Requirements (Building)" section of the top-level README describes the
original 2018 setup and is kept for reference.

## Layout

| Directory | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `BERT/` | The Excel add-in (`BERT64.xll`), the solution file, and the vcpkg configuration shared by the native projects |
| `ControlR/` | The R language controller, `ControlR.exe`. Hosts R out of process and talks to the add-in and the console over named pipes |
| `ControlJulia/`, `ControlJulia-0.7/` | The Julia language controllers, for Julia 0.6 and 0.7 |
| `Ribbon/` | The Excel ribbon COM add-in |
| `Console/` | The Electron console (editor and shell) |
| `PB/` | The protobuf schema for all inter-process messages, and the generated C++ |
| `Common/` | Code shared by the native projects |
| `Module/` | The `BERTModule` R package installed into the hosted R |
| `Install/` | The NSIS installer |
| `Build/` | Build output. Everything built lands here, next to the runtime configuration files that are checked in |

## Prerequisites

* Visual Studio 2026 (version 18) with the "Desktop development with C++"
  workload. The projects use the v145 toolset and the latest installed
  Windows SDK. For the ARM64EC configurations, add the ARM64/ARM64EC build
  tools component.
* vcpkg, as installed by Visual Studio. The native projects use vcpkg in
  manifest mode: each has a `vcpkg.json` naming its dependencies (protobuf),
  and `BERT/vcpkg-configuration.json` pins the registry baseline. The first
  build of each project installs the dependencies into a `vcpkg_installed/`
  directory beside it, which is ignored by git and can be deleted freely.
  The x64 configurations use the `x64-windows-static` triplet, so protobuf
  and abseil are linked into the binaries: like the rest of the build they
  use the static C runtime, and the shipped files need no Visual C++
  redistributable on the target machine.
* An R installation. The tree is currently built against R 4.5.2; see
  "The R installation" below.
* The Excel SDK, for the add-in project only.
* Node and yarn, for the console only.
* NSIS, for the installer only.

## The R installation

`ControlR` compiles against R's headers and links against import libraries
generated from R's DLLs. Both come from one R installation, named by the
MSBuild property `BertRHome`.

`BertRHome` defaults to `R-4.5.2` in the repository root, which is ignored
by git. Either copy your R installation there or point a junction at it:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path R-4.5.2 -Target "C:\Program Files\R\R-4.5.2"
```

To build against an R installed elsewhere, set the property on the command
line instead:

```powershell
msbuild ControlR\ControlR.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64 /p:BertRHome="C:\Program Files\R\R-4.5.2"
```

### Import libraries

`ControlR/lib/` holds the import libraries the controller links against, and
the `.def` export lists they were generated from, so that a change in the
export list is visible in review:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `R64.def`, `RGraphApp64.def` | Export lists of `R.dll` and `RGraphApp.dll`, taken from R 4.5.2 |
| `R64.lib`, `RGraphApp64.lib` | x64 import libraries built from those lists |
| `R64arm.lib`, `RGraphApp64arm.lib` | ARM64X import libraries built from the same lists, for the ARM64EC configurations |

To regenerate them from a different R, run `RebuildLibs.ps1` from a Visual
Studio developer PowerShell (it needs `dumpbin` and `lib`):

```powershell
cd ControlR\lib
.\RebuildLibs.ps1 -R "C:\Program Files\R\R-4.5.2" -def -x64 -ARM64
```

R for Windows has shipped x64 binaries only since 4.2.0, so the ARM64X
libraries are built from the x64 export lists, and the `-x86` switch is only
useful with an R old enough to include an i386 build.

### The UTF-8 code page manifest

`ControlR/controlr.manifest` is embedded in `ControlR.exe` and asks Windows
for the UTF-8 code page. R 4.2.0 and later use UTF-8 as their native
encoding only in a process that has it (R's own executables carry the same
manifest setting); without it, R embedded in the controller falls back to
the system code page, and strings outside that code page cannot exist in
the R session. The setting needs Windows 10 version 1903 or later and is
ignored on older systems. The controller checks the resulting code page at
startup and converts console text when it is not UTF-8.

### Why `R_LEGACY_RCOMPLEX` is defined

From 4.3.0, `R_ext/Complex.h` defines `Rcomplex` as a union whose second
member is a C99 `double _Complex`. MSVC does not implement `_Complex`, so the
header does not compile under MSVC without `R_LEGACY_RCOMPLEX`, which selects
the older two-`double` struct. The memory layout is the same either way, and
this code only reads and writes the `r` and `i` members. The define is set in
every `ControlR` configuration.

## Building

The full solution:

```powershell
msbuild BERT\BERT.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
```

Just the R controller, which is all you need when working on the R side:

```powershell
msbuild ControlR\ControlR.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
```

`msbuild` is at `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\18\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe`
if it is not on your path. x64 output goes to `Build\`; the ARM64EC configurations write to `ControlR\ARM64EC\<Configuration>\` instead.

The console is built separately with npm, from `Console/`:

```powershell
npm install
npm run build
npm run package
```

`npm install` also downloads the Electron binary. `npm run build` compiles
the stylesheet and the TypeScript into `build/`; `npm start` then runs the
console from source (it needs the environment the add-in sets, at least
`BERT_HOME`), and `npm run package` produces `Build\Console\win-unpacked`,
which is what the installer ships and what the add-in starts. The
dependencies are pinned by `package-lock.json`.

## Making a release

`Install\build-release.ps1` builds everything a release needs and packages
it:

```powershell
cd Install
.\build-release.ps1
```

It reads the version from `bert_version.h` (number plus tag), builds the
native projects, installs the `BERTModule` R package into `Build\module`
with the registered R (needs Rtools), packages the console, runs `makensis`
on `install-script.nsi`, and zips the same files with `INSTALL-FROM-ZIP.md`.
Each stage has a `-Skip...` switch; `-Version` and `-RHome` override the
detection. Outputs land in `Install\`: `BERT-Installer-<version>-x64.exe`
and `BERT-<version>-x64.zip`.

The installer is 64-bit only, does not bundle R, and installs over an
existing BERT 2 without touching `bert-config.json`, `user-stylesheet.less`
or `Documents\BERT2`; the console, module and startup directories are
replaced.

It looks for an R in three places, keeping the newest it finds: the
`InstallPath` an R installer records, per user and per machine, under both
`R-core\R64` and `R-core\R`; the per-version subkeys below those, which
survive when the top-level value is missing or points at an R that has been
removed; and `Program Files\R`, for an R that registered nothing. The one it
picks goes into `bert-languages.json` after the bundled `R-3.5.0` an older
installer may have left, so an existing installation moves to the installed
R without anyone editing a file, and `BERT.R.home` in `bert-config.json`
still overrides it. It says something only when it finds no R at all, or one
older than 4.2.

Function help in the formula bar is an optional component, off by default;
see `FUNCTION-HELP.md`. The build script downloads the third-party add-in
that component needs and checks it against a pinned hash, so that binary is
not in the repository.

The module is compiled with the R used for the build, so a release built
with R 4.5 needs R 4.x to load it.

## Running against your own R

BERT reads `Build\bert-languages.json` (installed as `bert-languages.json`
in the BERT directory) for the list of languages. Its default R home,
`%BERT_HOME%\R-3.5.0`, is the R that the installer used to bundle. To use
another R, set the home and library in `bert-config.json`, which lives in the
directory next to `BERT64.xll`, the directory BERT exports as `%BERT_HOME%`:

```json
"BERT": {
  "R": {
    "home": "C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-4.5.2",
    "lib": "C:\\Users\\you\\AppData\\Local\\R\\win-library\\4.5"
  }
}
```

Restart Excel after changing this section.

## Which versions of R the controller accepts

The controller checks the version reported by the loaded `R.dll` at startup
(`main` in `ControlR/src/controlr.cc`). It refuses to start under R older
than 3.5, warns but continues under a major series newer than 4, and
otherwise runs. The floor is the oldest series this code has been built
against; the reason there is no ceiling is that the loader resolves the
import libraries before `main` runs, so an R lacking a symbol the controller
needs has already failed to start by the time the check happens.

What has actually been exercised on this branch:

| R | Status |
| --- | --- |
| 4.5.2 | Built against. Used with Excel and the console |
| 4.2.2 | `ControlR.exe` starts under it and reports the version correctly. Not used with Excel |
| 3.5.0 | `ControlR.exe` starts under it and reports the version correctly. Not used with Excel |
| 3.5 to 4.1 generally | Expected to work, untested |

The one behavioural difference the controller keys off the version is
console output encoding. R for Windows switched its native encoding to
UTF-8 in 4.2.0; before that, console output arrived in the Windows code
page and the controller converts it to UTF-8. See `R_WriteConsoleEx` in
`ControlR/src/rinterface_win.cc`.
